<p class="head">Diving </p>
 
  Diving into the depth of the Inner Ocean.
  On the surface of events and impressions
  Set in motion,
  it foams and bubbles and roars,
  and if you stay on the surface of yourself,
  you are tossed about by thoughts and emotions
  to and fro. But if you dive into the
  the depth, you will find yourself.

<p class="head">What is a column? </p>
  <ul></ul>Columns are opinionated, usually short, usually in the same place, and usually written by the same writer. They usually end with a punch line and may well be polemical and thus protest against a particular view. The column found its way into the German newspaper landscape quite late, with papers from the USA serving as models.</li>
